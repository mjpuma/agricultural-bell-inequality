CRISIS PERIOD ANALYSIS SUMMARY REPORT\n==================================================\nGenerated: 2025-09-18 15:09:39\n\nCRISIS AMPLIFICATION EFFECTS:\n------------------------------\n\nCOVID-19 Food Disruption:\n  Average amplification: 4.5x\n  CORN-ADM: 6.3% → 79.0% (12.5x)\n  CORN-LEAN: 9.1% → 67.0% (7.3x)\n  SOYB-ADM: 10.9% → 13.4% (1.2x)\n  WEAT-GIS: 20.4% → 10.0% (0.5x)\n  CF-CORN: 14.0% → 67.4% (4.8x)\n  DE-CORN: 13.7% → 11.0% (0.8x)\n\n2012 US Drought:\n  Average amplification: 4.5x\n  CORN-ADM: 5.7% → 66.3% (11.6x)\n  CORN-LEAN: 9.3% → 67.3% (7.2x)\n  SOYB-ADM: 8.3% → 5.0% (0.6x)\n  WEAT-GIS: 19.7% → 17.1% (0.9x)\n  CF-CORN: 13.0% → 75.9% (5.9x)\n  DE-CORN: 8.3% → 8.0% (1.0x)\n\n2008 Global Food Crisis:\n  Average amplification: 7.2x\n  CORN-ADM: 3.2% → 69.9% (21.9x)\n  CORN-LEAN: 5.1% → 72.5% (14.2x)\n  SOYB-ADM: 16.2% → 11.8% (0.7x)\n  WEAT-GIS: 28.3% → 6.5% (0.2x)\n  CF-CORN: 14.6% → 78.3% (5.3x)\n  DE-CORN: 13.7% → 8.9% (0.6x)\n\nTHRESHOLD SENSITIVITY:\n--------------------\n  0.75 quantile: 76.6% violations\n  0.80 quantile: 79.0% violations\n  0.85 quantile: 79.0% violations\n  0.90 quantile: 49.8% violations\n  0.95 quantile: 0.0% violations\n  0.99 quantile: 0.0% violations\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n---------------\n• Crisis periods show amplified Bell inequality violations\n• Supply chain relationships (CORN-ADM, CORN-LEAN) most affected\n• Higher thresholds reduce sensitivity but maintain crisis detection\n• Quantum-like correlations emerge during market stress\n• Food system vulnerabilities revealed through Bell violations
